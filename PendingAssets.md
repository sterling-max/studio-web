# Sterling Lab - Pending Assets

To achieve the full "Sterling" aesthetic, the following placeholder elements should be replaced with high-quality custom assets:

## 1. Product Screenshots / Mockups
In `src/components/ProductCard.tsx`, the colored icons are currently placeholders. Consider adding:
- **Max Commander**: A high-resolution UI mockup showing the dual-pane acrylic interface.
- **Dash**: A mockup of the "Infinite Glide Lyrics" or the glassmorphic player.
- **Zap Studio**: A frame from a generated children's story video.
- **EasyMonitor**: A screenshot of the interactive trend charts on a mobile device.
- **Tales Universe**: A preview of the fairy-tale library interface.

## 2. Brand Identity
- **Favicon**: Replace the default Vite SVG in `public/` with a Sterling "S" or "Shield" logo.
- **Logo**: If a vector logo exists, replace the text "Sterling Lab" in `App.tsx` and `Navbar.tsx` with an SVG component.

## 3. Background Textures
- Currently, the site uses CSS gradients and blurs.
- Consider adding subtle noise textures or high-resolution "mist" overlays to `src/index.css` to enhance the "Atmospheric Depth" feel.

## 4. Typography
- The site currently uses `Inter` from the system font stack.
- To elevate the "Premium" feel, consider licensing a font like **Geist**, **Manrope**, or a custom grotesque sans-serif.

## 5. Case Studies
- The "View Case Study" buttons are currently non-functional. 
- High-quality imagery and detailed write-ups for each product will be needed for these sections.
